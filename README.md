# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

This repository contains the four neural network projects I completed throughout Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). Originally forked from [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), I deleted the excess course material to ease navigation and added my solutions to the projects.

Rather than readmes, the individual projects are explained and solved through Jupyter Notebooks. Click the below links to see just how each NN works (and feel free to skip to the end if you want to see the resultant trained model in action). 

## Projects

* [Basic Neural Network](https://github.com/ilogan/deep-learning/tree/master/nn_bikeshare_predictor/Your_first_neural_network.ipynb): Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/ilogan/deep-learning/tree/master/cnn_dog_classifier/dog_app.ipynb): Build a convolutional neural network to identify various dog breeds.
* [Text Generation](https://github.com/ilogan/deep-learning/tree/master/rnn_tvscript_writer/dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb): Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/ilogan/deep-learning/tree/master/gan_face_generator/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
